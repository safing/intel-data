  release-announcement-v2-stable:
    title: "Portmaster v2 Official Release"
    message: |
        We’re excited to announce the official release of Portmaster v2! The latest stable version of v2 is our recommended default for all Portmaster users.

        Portmaster v2 doesn’t introduce flashy new features, but it brings major foundational improvements that pave the way for future innovation and stability. These core changes require a fresh install, as they couldn’t be delivered via auto-update.
        
        Key improvements:
        - Offline Installers  
        Set up Portmaster without needing an internet connection — perfect for secure or air-gapped environments.

        - Streamlined Updates  
        Updates now download and install faster and use less storage, making the whole process more efficient.

        - Better Linux Support  
        Improved compatibility with immutable Linux distributions such as Fedora Silverblue and NixOS.

        - Smarter DNS Monitoring  
        Enhanced VPN compatibility and privacy, with more robust DNS monitoring.

        - Modern Database Engine  
        A switch to an SQLite backend increases stability and keeps the database lean.

        Upgrading to Portmaster v2 is simple. The installer will automatically migrate your existing v1 configuration and remove Portmaster v1, ensuring a smooth transition.

        If you need to revert for any reason, you can easily roll back: just uninstall Portmaster v2 and reinstall v1 - your settings will be preserved. Note: Leave ‘Delete application data’ unchecked on Windows during the uninstall process.

        Please share your feedback and any issues you encountered via [GitHub](https://github.com/safing/portmaster/issues) or on [Discord](https://safing.io/discord).

  filterlist-trim-oisd-nsfw:
    title: "Optimizing OISD-NSFW Filter List"
    message: |
      Portmaster has been using the OISD-NSFW filter list for a long time now. While this is a high quality list, it has grown very fast in the last years and is beginning to impact Portmaster performance.

      Fortunately, OISD offers a smaller variant of their NSFW list, which Portmaster will switch to in the coming days. This change is automatic and there is nothing you have to do.

      In case you want to continue using the [complete OISD-NSFW filter list](https://oisd.nl/setup), you can still [download it manually from HERE](https://oisd.nl/setup) and tell Portmaster to use it by configuring the Customer Filter List setting.
    match: 'Config.filter/lists.#[%\"NSFW\"] exists or Config.filter/lists.#[%\"NSFWM\"] exists or Config.filter/lists.#[%\"OISD-NSFW\"] exists'
