  release-announcement-v2:
    title: "Test Portmaster v2 beta"
    message: |
        Portmaster v2 is now available in beta. We invite you to test the new version and give your feedback.

        New additions:
        - Offline installers
        - A new and improved update system (less storage required)
        - Correct install paths (e.g. improved support for immutable distros)
        - DNS Monitoring (better VPN compatibility)
        - SQLite Database Backend (better stability and smaller databases)

        Install notes:
        - During the Portmaster v2 install process, your configuration from Portmaster v1 is copied and Portmaster v1 is removed
        - To roll back to v1, simply uninstall Portmaster v2 and install Portmaster v1 again 

        Download links for v2 beta are available in the Beta section on the [Portmaster Download page](https://safing.io/download/#beta). 

        Please share your feedback and any issues you encountered via [GitHub](https://github.com/safing/portmaster/issues) or the dedicated beta channel on our [Discord](https://safing.io/discord).

        Thank you for participating!

  filterlist-trim-oisd-nsfw:
    title: "Optimizing OISD-NSFW Filter List"
    message: |
      Portmaster has been using the OISD-NSFW filter list for a long time now. While this is a high quality list, it has grown very fast in the last years and is beginning to impact Portmaster performance.

      Fortunately, OISD offers a smaller variant of their NSFW list, which Portmaster will switch to in the coming days. This change is automatic and there is nothing you have to do.

      In case you want to continue using the [complete OISD-NSFW filter list](https://oisd.nl/setup), you can still [download it manually from HERE](https://oisd.nl/setup) and tell Portmaster to use it by configuring the Customer Filter List setting.
